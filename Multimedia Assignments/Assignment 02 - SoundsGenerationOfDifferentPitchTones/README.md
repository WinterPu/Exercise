# Assignment 02 Sounds Generation Of Different PitchTones
## The format you design for the input text file of musical notes.



### Each Musical Note:

You can type musical notes with both format:

`character： C  C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B

number:       1  12  2  22  3  4  42  5  52   6 62   7 

(use 12 to represent C# )`



if you want to denote 2 beats, you can use: -2

so for each :

`number: 1,12, 1-2, 12-2

character C, C# , C-2, C#-2`


### Overall:

use whitespace-character to seperate two musical notes.

### for example:

`5  4-2 6 7 22-2 12`

## The problem(s) encountered and the way you solve it(them), if any.



It is a little troublesome to deal with wav file's data part.





## The discussions/summaries on your results, and what you have learned in this assignment


need to be improved


- learn a simple method to synthesize music
- learn some about WAV format


When Design a Type:
Remember to try to keep the complete data.
When outputing, do the lossy transformation.
