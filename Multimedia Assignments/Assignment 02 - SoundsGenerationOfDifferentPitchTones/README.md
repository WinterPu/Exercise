## The format you design for the input text file of musical notes.



Each Musical Note:

You can type musical notes with both format:

character： C  C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B

number:       1  12  2  22  3  4  42  5  52   6 62   7 

(use 12 to represent C# )



if you want to denote 2 beats, you can use: -2

so :

for number: 1,12, 1-2, 12-2

for character C, C# , C-2, C#-2



Overall:

use whitespace-character to seperate two musical notes.

for example:

5  4-2 6 7 22-2 12
